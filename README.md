# MockDOS - Salamanet
This project is not only my personal site, but also a look at JavaScript if it was developed 40 years ago.

# Documentation
MockDOS is not for the faint of heart. It is designed to be easy to use if you are already familiar with BATCH or powershell.

Currently, there is no help function (though it is in the works).

For now, let this be a starter guide:

To call a function follow this syntax: [Func Name] [Arguement(s) seperated by spaces]
example: print "hello world" -> Hello World is printed to the screen

MockDOS Functions:

Print: [Text], optional arguement [Color] - Prints a message with an optional color arguement.

tInstall: [CDN URL] - attempts to load a library from an external source.

cls: NO ARGUEMENTS - Clears the screen
